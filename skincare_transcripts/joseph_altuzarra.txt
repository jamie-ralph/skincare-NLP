hey i'm joseph altuzara and i'm going to
show you
my nighttime skincare routine and what i
do to get ready to go to bed
[Music]
today i'm going to use 10 products my
skin is combination so
sort of oily in the t-zone kind of dry
on the cheeks but um because
it is december and my skin during the
winter tends to
kind of look a little dull and dry i
try to spend a little more time on my
skin uh especially at night when i have
more time
and it makes me feel good to sort of
take care of my skin and get ready
for bed so i start most nights with this
um tata harper regenerating cleanser
i love that a this smells really
delicious and b
that it is an um
exfoliating cleanser but the
exfoliating part is not too
aggressive i think i went through a
phase
like in my 20s when i just thought like
the harder you scrubbed
the better your skin would be and
actually
my skin kind of got worse so
now when i exfoliate my skin which i do
think is
important at least for my skin type i
try to make sure
that it's not too aggressive
okay so this is one trick that i learned
from
watching tata harper and gucci westman
actually
they applied this and then
they put on the resurfacing mask also
from tata harper
and my skin is a little sensitive during
the winter and
this has done wonders
to kind of like calm my skin down
and just make it feel
really nourished and hydrated
um it really calms down the redness
around my nose
and it just makes my skin feel
so healthy and like i
am giving it a nice spa treatment
so once you have both of these products
on
you're supposed to let them sit which
i'm gonna do
um but on top of that i actually use
this estee lauder advanced
night repair eye mask i never used to
take care of
my under eye area i've only really
started
doing it over the last couple years and
it's
two patches and you have this little
liquid in here and the really
fun bit is that you push it up
and the serum
pops into
the area that the eye patches are in
and you kind of let them imbibe and
soak for a couple seconds
then i open it up and
apply each one
to my under eye area
there we go
so i'm going to leave the whole thing
sit for 10 minutes
and what i usually do is
i sit on the edge of my bathtub and i
read
a book so i'm gonna do that and i'll be
back okay
so it's been 10 minutes and
my skin is actually starting to tangle a
little bit which
um always happens so i'm going to take
these off
and i am going to rinse all
of it off
okay so
from here you know i sort of feel like
i've
exfoliated all of the grime from
my skin and i sort of got like a little
bit of a glow up
the next step is this sk2 facial
treatment essence
i started using this a couple of years
ago someone recommended it
i put a couple of drops of it in my hand
and it actually made
the texture of my skin just a lot better
and it's kind of calming too so
i don't know if it's psychosomatic i
really love using this i use it on the
plane
a lot um like if my skin is feeling kind
of dry on the plane
i'll use this and i kind of let it i try
to
you know let things sit it's sometimes
hard at night because you're so
tired and you just want to like go to
bed um
but you're sort of supposed to like let
the essences and the serums sit you're
not supposed to like stack everything on
top of each other so
i sort of give it a minute the next
thing i use
is this is clinical active serum
and if if i am not going to do the full
routine
like i'm just exhausted and i need to go
to bed
right away i'll wash my face
and use this and put on moisturizer
this is the thing that i use no matter
what i
struggled actually over
um kind of quarantine with a little bit
of acne
and i think it was stress
and not sleeping well and just
kind of anxiety and maybe not eating
well and not
drinking enough water and i
started using this and it really helped
my skin
it helped with breakouts it helped with
pores
like clogged pores um
it also kind of helped my skin just
looks
look a little less like dull so i'll let
that kind of
um seep into my skin and while
that's doing its magic on my face
i'll use um this lemare um
lifting eye serum and this is
probably the fanciest thing that i
or the fanciest step because i feel like
it's kind of extra to use eye serum
but i've become kind of obsessed with
like my under eye skin and just making
sure
i am taking care of it and i'll do a
little drop on my ring finger
and then apply it on my
under eye and you
want to try to not like swipe and
just be really gentle with the skin
around your eyes
and you can feel that it gets absorbed
really quickly
so i kind of let that do its thing and
the is clinical feels like it's all
absorbed in my skin
so next i use this dr barbara stern
super anti-aging serum i
have been really lucky to
work with barbara sturm um and get
some treatments with her and my skin is
always so much better
after i see her so anything she tells me
to do
i will do um so this is a
um hyaluronic acid serum
and i kind of swish it in my hands and
then
i apply it to my face
and kind of with this one i don't know
why i do this but i kind of give myself
a little bit of a massage always do your
neck
uh i like every product that i put on my
face i usually put on my neck
and that's something actually my mom
taught me
when i was a teenager i had really
[Music]
really bad acne and i had to go on
accutane
and i was so self-conscious about it my
mom
taught me a lot of little tricks and you
know the thing about acne especially
when you're a teenager is there's not
much you can do i mean you can
you can you know wash your face and
exfoliate and
you know do treatments but it's kind of
hormonal
she really helped me kind of deal with
it and um
and a lot of what i learned in skin care
came from her okay the last serum that i
put on
is this calming serum from dr
sturm and this i actually only use
during the winter
especially if it's just really cold and
then i'm inside
and my skin feels really dry from the
heating
and it just really helps with kind of
reactive skin it helps with kind of my
areas of redness
and dryness and sensitivity
it's an overall just kind of great
product for skin
if your skin is feeling kind of stressed
so it feels like i'm putting on a lot
actually
but it doesn't feel like it on my skin
everything kind of is absorbing nicely
the second to last step is actually this
lemur eye cream which i've had for
ever and i apply it with my ring finger
again
i do the same kind of tapping motion
if you couldn't tell i'm a little bit of
like a
skincare junkie i've tried a lot of
things
and i really just love
this product it feels really hydrating
and no matter the season
or sort of what my skin is going through
it's a really great
great product and then the last thing i
use
is the augustinist bader
the cream the cream i actually met
someone who worked there
and who was telling me about how it was
developed and
um what it did
and i tried it
and became a huge fan first of all
i love that it doesn't really smell like
anything
i used to wear another night cream which
had this really like heavy floral scent
and it was so distracting
when i was going to bed it just kind of
made it feel like i was
sleeping in like a potpourri or
something it was just so strong
um so i like that it actually doesn't
smell like anything
but it's also when you put it on it's
very smooth it absorbs really quickly
and it makes my skin just feel so
hydrated and when i wake up in the
morning i have to say
since using this when i wake up in the
morning my skin
just feels way more glowy and that
is it that's my skincare routine i am
going to go to bed
but thank you guys so much for watching

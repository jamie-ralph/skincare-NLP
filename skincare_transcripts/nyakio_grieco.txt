hi i'm mikayo grieco founder of mako
beauty and co-founder of 13 loon and
tonight i'm going to show you my
nighttime routine
[Music]
i love taking a bath and so i just got
out of the bath and most of the products
that i use
are from 13 loon which is our new
e-commerce site
where we celebrate amplify and highlight
black and brown founders founders people
of color who make products for all
so last night um i was wash day so i
used
this incredible forbidden hair mask by
um
bamba curls and it's so good it smells
delicious
it's yummy yellow color so i just
applied this to my hair yesterday after
shampooing
left it on for 20 minutes and it just
kind of gives you that silky glow
so that was kind of pre tonight and then
before my bath today
i love a dry brush and this brush is by
gilded beauty and a dry brush is just an
amazing way
to exfoliate your skin and help you get
to that baby soft skin i always say that
like anti-aging is not just from the
neck
up i mean we've gotta uh take care of
our skin from head to toe so i use this
all over my body and took a bath and now
my skin feels silky soft
and my skin tends to run really really
dry so i love to use body oils and body
foams after and
kind of give myself that extra love
especially in these winter months
this oil i love is by the established
it's so good
um it's more like a dry oil so when you
put it on
it doesn't leave your skin feeling
greasy at all your skin just kind of
drinks it up and it's
just so divine and then i follow up
with this body bomb like how gorgeous is
this packaging by gilded
this body balm look how thick it is for
us
girls that run extra dry this is my very
favorite so
a little goes a long way and i just take
this
and i apply it all over my body and it
just leaves my skin feeling hydrated it
too smells
delicious and all of these founders just
put so much love
into these products so now we're going
to move on to my face
first i'm going to start with these
flaunt wipes by laura napier
i was never a big face white person
before i discovered these wipes but
you know i'm all about making sure that
our pores are completely clean
before we start any treatment i'm going
to start with this
and just kind of wipe off the face and
neck area
and then i'm going to follow up with our
niko sweet almond cleansing balm
i believe in double cleansing um it's
borrowed from korean beauty
it's just a way to make sure once again
that we're getting our pores
extra clean before we start our
treatment but what i love about this
balm
um is we use sweet almonds in it which
are packed with antioxidants in the niko
brand
so you're actually getting some
hydration in your skin
as you're also cleansing um when you
have makeup on
this really just tends to just like melt
the makeup off your face tons of makeup
artists love to carry this product in
their kit
because it's just a really really easy
way to wash your face
but i'm going to make this even more of
a treatment by
taking a you know warm washcloth and
kind of giving myself that
spa effect oh my god i feel so good
and wiping it all off so if you have
makeup it melts off your makeup
otherwise it just kind of melts off
those impurities but it leaves your skin
feeling soft and hydrated back in the
day we would think that when we cleansed
our skin and it felt like dry and tight
it meant it was clean and then
you get a little older and you realize
that's not the way to go
so this leaves that like hydration and
softness in the skin
so now i can start treating
so next speaking of treatment i'm going
to move on to
the joanna vargas exfoliating mask this
mask is so good
i preach that we should exfoliate at
least twice a week
that really just helps to slough off all
that dull dry
skin help to reveal that kind of baby
soft skin
especially in winter months and you know
if you live in areas where you're going
from hot to cold and hot to cold that's
so
rough on our skin so we just want to be
able to use a gentle exfoliant
and i love the color of this product
it's gold it makes me feel
regal joanna vargas is a amazing
esthetician
and she makes some incredible products
and this feels
so good so it's also cleansing too
but i can just feel all of the
extra dry skin will be removed
and will leave a glow so normally i like
to leave this on
for like 10 to 15 minutes we'll brush my
teeth
and it's still going to have the effect
i'm going to rinse it off and reveal my
glue
hold please so i'm back and i'm glowing
like a light bulb
so next i'm going to use
the nikeo maracuja and yangu rescue oil
this oil is naturally colored green
so it helps to alleviate redness in our
skin
this really helps to balance out our
skin and as some of you know i learned
all my beauty secrets from my
grandparents my grandmother was a canyon
coffee farmer
so i work with things like coffee
extract in my products
my grandfather was a medicine man so i
learned about the power of restorative
oils from my grandfather
he went out in nature to extract oils to
treat the skin
and ailments and so these family beauty
secrets were passed down to me
and now i'm sharing them with you we're
born with a certain amount of oils and
then as we age we lose those oils so we
have to feed that oil back into our skin
in order to you know maintain our
ageless glow so one of the ways i really
love to use this product
is by using this new magical wand by
shawnee garden shawnee darden is my
esthetician
and dear friend and this might be one of
the best tools i've ever used in my life
this is her um new sculpting wand
and it's so great i'm going to show you
how i use it so i just applied the oil
she's got
a gel that she sells with this product
as well but i like to use my oil
and basically i mean it feels so good
you just use it to sculpt and tighten
the skin
and it uses sound therapy so it's like
so relaxing um and you do this you can
go up from the jawline
the chin to the jawline you do this
three times on either side
i'm going to finish this off when i
actually get in bed um but i'm just
showing you
just the wonder of this wand
also i always say don't neglect the neck
i'll just show you you can start at the
collarbone
and move up and this helps to sculpt
the neck and jawline as well it also
comes with another disc
that you can use under the eye area it's
a little ball
here you can use around the lip area so
this is one of those things i love to do
like right before i go to sleep because
it's so relaxing so i'm going to finish
that later
but then we've also got um this vitamin
c
serum by butter this brand was founded
by
a model dorian renault he's so
incredible his products are so good
and you know i say don't be afraid of
oils it's like i said before as we age
we lose those oils we gotta feed oil
back into your skin a lot of people
think
oh i have oily skin i don't want to put
oil on my face
i tend to think you might need oil even
more because that means your skin's
working too hard to produce the oils so
you gotta feed oil back into your skin
to help it relax
but this vitamin c serum and at night
like sometimes i use moisturizers but i
often like to use
a serum even over my oil to just kind of
help seal in that moisture
and this vitamin c serum is so great
packed with antioxidants um just helps
your skin when you're going into that
repair mode as you sleep
to uh wake up with that natural glow
it feels so good and i even like to add
a little bit here under the eyes
and speaking of eyes my next step is
using this joanna vargas
bright eye hydrating mask and so i like
to apply these
leave them on for like you know 10 to 15
minutes
kind of freaks my husband out but i love
it
but it feels so good
look i'm like a skincare superhero
oh my god it feels so good feels so good
and it's got a serum in it so it really
helps to
kind of hydrate that under eye area this
i love that it's not like your general
like
under eye patches that you get the whole
eye area
um so what else what else i think we're
almost done
don't forget your lips you know that um
people are always concerned and think
that the under eye area and the crow's
feet areas where we show age first
no no no it's all around the mouth so
you want to make sure
that you're keeping your pout
hydrated and this dream slip
by sarah happ is so good
you literally wake up in the morning and
your lips are still hydrated i keep one
in my purse
i use this before bedtime it's hands
down
best lip balm and then my last step
is i like to add a little extra
hydration into my hair
and so i'm going to use the charlotte
mensah manchetti oil manchetti oil is
also an african oil and i'm very partial
to african oils
and this oil is so great a little goes a
long way
but this gives your hair that little
extra piece of hydration and love that
you need before bedtime and
voila i think that's it it's time for me
to go to bed
let this eye serum soak in a little bit
and thank you all i love sharing my
nighttime routine with you and sharing
all of our wonderful
tips and tricks good night

hey beauties it's me sasha velour
quarantined international drag queen
extraordinaire
and tonight i would like to invite you
to go to bed with me
favorite part about drag is sometimes
removing it at the end of the night yes
drag is uncomfortable
actually all gender is uncomfortable
high femininity in particular you got
your lashes
your itchy wig your tight clothes it's
really great feeling to then
uh free yourself and peel it
all off at the end of the night plus
i love a transformation
and this is one that i do just for me
let's get to it i actually i'm gonna
remove my earrings for this
if you learn one thing from my video
today
take your makeup off
if you hear one thing i say it's this
you must remove your makeup at the end
of
every night i have talked to some drag
performers who do not
it is like the essence of my beauty
routine
you can use whatever you want i always
like to
use a little
telesis extra strength adhesive
remover there's some extra strong beauty
products on my face
um i usually go in with like a little
makeup wipe sephora rose
and what i do is i will go into all the
areas that have i don't know if you can
tell
but i have some heavy uh makeup
application on this face
so i'm gonna go in and i just spray
directly
onto this and then i'm just gonna wipe
it off it's gonna get scary
i'm gonna do this so that
i don't then smear this into the rest of
my face
any more than i need to and a little up
here even though i did actually cover my
eyebrows so
that is going to take a little more to
remove i think ah
there i'm done let's go to bed
uh you can use cold cream you know i'm
gonna get a little further and then i'm
gonna talk to you also
i didn't even realize i still had these
up
now i'm gonna spray this all over my
face and get it
okay i actually have makeup back here as
well so
uh you can use cold cream coconut oil
whatever works for you
uh go cheap you know dish soap now i
don't recommend that the person who
taught me the most about
uh skincare and all of that is
definitely my mom she had two products
ivory bar soap and neutrogena
moisturizer
and she would wash her face and then put
moisturizer on and she was like
sasha good skin care is literally
as simple as that you gotta clean your
face every day and then you put new
moisturizer on
thankfully since becoming a drag queen
i've learned that you can use
very very expensive products and that
that does absolutely nothing
but it does help you experience your
fall fantasies
which we always support makeup off
makeup off that's the first step
get your makeup off there we go
you can even see my brows um i cover my
eyebrows with
spirit gum but first i use alcohol to
get all the oils out then spirit gum
glue stick and setting powder and it
makes a nice little
piece of pottery over your eyebrows that
you can paint a new face
more feminine face on two it is a
technique that has been used by
femme performers since the dawn of time
i'm just gonna say that i
don't know since my eyebrows are still
completely
covered in this glue-like substance that
allowed me to paint over them
i'm gonna go in with a little virgin
unrefined
coconut oil to remove that
i have tried every product and none
works as well as this and i literally
just go in i go to go in with
my washcloth
and like get that in to the eyebrow and
really rub it in
it's gonna take a while let me just
really go in there
let it go chaotic you know
i'm gonna take a little more and put on
my eyes as well
use very hot water it's my little sink
[Music]
yeah i need one okay i'll be right back
a great shower i actually cheated while
i was in there and used a little bit
more soap
a little i want to get it really really
clean like i said first step
remove your makeup use a little ceramic
slip
sunday riley cleanser okay next up
before my face even dries in fact
let me get a little more water on that
i'm gonna put on
my sunday riley
oils um i do love that's a little too
i do love putting on faith oil
to just like re-enliven
the skin after removing everything from
it
i either use this one or i have
the juno antioxidant one i love these
products miss faramon introduced me to
these when we were touring
after season nine of rupaul's drag race
and i have been absolutely addicted
ever since just put that on or her has
like a magical
greenish color neck
chest oh yeah scalp all over
into the eyebrows and you can keep
adding stuff there
some sometimes i use a little like
lactic acid
products sometimes that i use like a
special little
eye dabby thing it doesn't none of it
really
matters what you need for skin care is
good clean products
that you are using to take off your
makeup and good clean products that you
are
then putting onto your face um so i'm
gonna put on a little fresh
rose moisturizer this product um it just
smells so good and it's like
cold i love a hot shower it turns on my
skin pink and this
brings me back
okay and that
is literally as simple as it is little
lip balm
some badgers on it good to
go one final step
i have literally been wearing
this necklace to sleeve so you can check
this out
uh purchase it on my website and you
know let's just do one
last thing that i do every night before
bed i'm gonna take you with me
i believe that you need a little cold
air like nature that's the final step
uh we're just gonna run up to the roof
so come on guys it'll be so good
well thank you so much for coming to bed
with me that's my goodnight ritual

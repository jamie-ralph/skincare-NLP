my name is ago odom and you could go to
bed with me i mean okay
that's a lie you can't come to bed with
me i don't know you and you don't know
me you don't want to be in my bed you
don't know me like that i don't know you
like that so you're gonna go to your bed
i'ma stay in my bed and everybody
everybody's going to go to bed
separately
but you can get ready for bed with me
my skincare routine is so important to
me because i'm just trying to get my
makeup off and go to sleep if i go to
sleep with makeup on
i'm waking up with pimples immediately
first thing in the morning
so i have to get the makeup all off it
is a nice little
routine for pre-bed like a little
self-care
by popping off but also guys a little
key here
a little trick i take my makeup off
basically as soon as i get home because
if i actually wait till i'm too tired
taking the makeup off and doing the
whole routine kind of wakes me up
and we don't want that because we want
to go to bed it could be 4 p.m it could
be 5
6. you know how to count but it's just a
matter of when i get
home my skin i would say is
combination but i feel like it has to be
from what i've read
it has to be oily and dry to be
combination and mine is really like oily
and normal in some spots
so like maybe it's combination but it's
mostly oily
yeah it's mostly oily i'm in denial it's
oily i got oily skin but they say
people with oily skin will age well so
take that
first thing i do is use this is new to
me by the way
before i tell you what it is this is new
i used to use makeup wipes
and then i got this sample of this
specific thing
at sephora green clean um
makeup melt away cleansing balm from
pharmacy
oh my gosh i'm really giving vlogger
vibes right now
okay no shade to the vloggers love and
respect for y'all
also after i got this i went about the
full size i went and bought the big boy
because that's the power of samples and
that's why they do it that's why they do
it to convince you to buy it
and we know that and i like to think i'm
not susceptible but i fell for it
but i like this i really like this i got
this and then i discovered i
i don't know if i've been living under a
rock or what but makeup wipes are
actually really bad for the environment
so this one's for you environment that's
why i got it
it comes with a little uh spatula i like
this little spatula because most days i
don't cook so this feels like a little
i'm a little chef or something i'll take
a little bit goes a long way
am i a blogger i think i'm a blogger
okay
um but for real though a little bit goes
a long way and i take it right off the
spatula and guys
this is the magic and you just put it
all over your face okay i'm gonna close
my eyes
one eye at a time i'm still watching you
i feel like i'd
like when i was younger i would watch
scary documentaries or like
oh what is it unsolved mysteries then
i'd have to get ready for bed
and i'd be scared to wash my face
because you have to close your eyes both
your eyes have to be closed at some
point
when you're washing your face and that
used to terrify me like having to close
my eyes to wash my face
this is a sign that i'm grown and i'm
not scared no more
so you get it all over your face and
then you're going to rinse it off
you rinse it off and then the makeup is
going to be gone so i'll be right back
now we make up free i'm not married to
any particular face wash for this step
of the process
but for this next step i use
right now currently i'm using olay
cleanse gentle foaming cleanser i bought
this on a trip
because i was out of what i normally use
which is neutrogena's oil-free
makeup remover cleanser it comes in a
blue bottle
i just work working into a nice lather
in my hands i love the lather
it feels like it's working now
estheticians will tell you you don't
need the lather
i don't know i don't know honey don't
stop me i'm addicted to the lather
okay now you really don't want to open
your eyes on this step because
this will burn so i'm going to wash this
off
okay so i feel confident
that the makeup is gone i know this is
not correct but listen it works for me
okay
i washed my face a third time with a low
benzoyl peroxide this clean and clear
acne cleansers 10 benzoyl peroxide now i
know
people gonna be mad but i this is what i
do people don't like benzoyl peroxide i
do it works for me
i mean masks right now i'm having to
wear the mask is breaking me out a lot
in this area but this right here this
right here is good i put a little bit on
my hand and then while my face is still
wet
from my previous two cleanses but the
other one is just melting away the
makeup so i don't really feel like that
counts
i just like to do that second wash to
really make sure it's all gone and this
one i feel is like a treatment for my
skin i just like it because it's got
that active ingredient benzoyl peroxide
i know some people like salicylic acid i
find that to be way too drying
i haven't used that since high school
but maybe there's benzoyl peroxide okay
let me tell you i rock with this
voila we're ready for bed it's like i'm
gonna wash this off
okay do you guys remember those um clean
and clear commercials and like all the
face washing commercials probably
neutrogena too
where the girls used to like splash the
water on their face to take off the
cleanser
you don't you can't do that at home you
really can't do it at all that's just
for tv
because you do that you have a mess
behind you get your hair all messed up
okay dry off we're done with the washing
portion okay
so for people who say that's too many
washing steps well guess what we're done
the next step is i do a toner
and i use right now this
thayer's facial toner rose petal it's
alcohol free
that's important to me i don't want
alcohol on you you don't want alcohol on
your face guys
that's very dry even if you have oily
skin i read that
somewhere you could thank me later or
you could
read stuff yourself got it at a
drugstore i think walgreens dwayne reed
you know that his name dwayne reed and
walgreens dwayne read by walgreens
and you heard that here first use this
little toner
and you know you are supposed to
use it up swipe up
link in bio that's what they say and so
i do it
i just i do a lot of what they say who
are they i don't
know if you find out who they are let me
know
this is what i do next after i do the
toner i use an eye cream
it's by fresh it says it firms and
illuminates
i'm added a little firming and
eliminating okay
and just do a little now you're supposed
to use your non-dominant hand to do your
eye
someone told me that someone told me
that not they but someone
unfortunately i am using my dominant
hand i
am right handed and i'm using my right
hand but i do use
a weaker finger my middle finger i
didn't mean to i don't want to flip you
off but my middle finger is weakest
because i don't flip people off so i use
this
bam on my eyes and i just stab it you
don't want to be rubbing and pulling
under your eyes
so then i use this my holy grail
cuddly vino perfect radiant serum
complexion correcting
this serum is my jam i live and i die by
this
when i die bury me with this i get so
many compliments on my skin when i use
this and i secretly
have conducted an experiment and i don't
wear it i don't get as many compliments
but i do wear it
everybody's like ooh your skin your skin
this
right here is my jam it's really good
for dark spots
and making your skin radiant the other
thing i tell people all the time is i
drink a lot of water
and i just dab a little bit on my face
and i rub it in and i rub it in
let it settle into your skin
let it become one with you become one
with the serum
i'm using this serum for years i got a
sample at sephora they'd be getting me
with the dang samples
but anyway this right here after that i
was like let me go ahead and get
something else in that same line so i
just like i don't know a month ago
maybe started using this cuddly vino
perfect
brightening glycolic night cream dab a
little bit
and i just feel like it makes me so
radiant it makes my skin feel
so supple okay
so that's it that's it y'all that is my
nighttime skin care routine make sure

heard of it
check it out check it out sometime

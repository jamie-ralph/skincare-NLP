- Okay, what do YouTubers do,
when they go... (laughs)
But seriously, be right back.
(soft music)
Hey guys, I'm Madison Bailey,
and tonight I'm gonna be showing you guys
my nighttime routine.
So, I don't have super sensitive skin,
I can kind of throw whatever on my face,
and my skin's like, meh.
So, I change my products out frequently,
just 'cause I find things that I want to try,
and I'll try it out and use that for awhile
and then I'll try something else.
Sometimes my nighttime routine is taking off my makeup
and laying in my bed,
and other times,
it's a couple steps, and it's like a real part of my night,
just to relax, and unwind.
Yeah, so I only use a couple of products,
I'll have like three or four things, so.
Let's get started!
First thing I'm gonna do, I'm gonna put my hair up.
Step one. Always.
So the first thing I'm gonna be using and have been using
since I've been wearing makeup, since I was 14,
Neutrogena Makeup Removers.
I just got a new pack.
(rustling)
So satisfying.
I didn't do that in the most satisfying way.
But.
It was great.
I had a good time.
So I'm gonna take this,
and this will take off all my makeup.
I usually only need one, which is nice.
We won't go there.
We won't go there right now.
I usually don't wear a full face of foundation,
but today I felt like it.
Yes, I swear by these makeup remover wipes.
Because it just gets everything off,
and I only have to use one.
All is well.
Step one, done.
Okay guys, so the next product that I use,
I'm currently on the Burt's Bees Peach and Willow Bark.
I use it with my Tarte face brush, one side's like a brush,
and one side's like an exfoliating shindig.
So, I'm just gonna
wet my face a little.
And then,
that should be sufficient.
I usually do that and use the brush side
when I'm washing it off.
Okay, what do YouTubers do,
when they go... (laughs)
But seriously, be right back.
Okay, so the next thing that I'm going to do,
I'm gonna use the Neutrogena Rapid Clear
daily leave-on mask.
And I don't put it all over my face, I just put it in
a couple spots.
Just any spot that needs a little extra love,
you know what I mean.
Okay, now the next thing I'm gonna use,
I use this, I saw this at Urban Outfitters,
it's an anti-stress serum for nighttime.
And, it's pretty, and it smells good,
and it makes my skin feel really really soft
when I wake up.
And just a little here.
Little here.
Okay, so anybody who knows me knows
I love my crystals, so obviously,
after a long day, this is not an everyday thing,
because it's time-consuming,
I love to use my rose quartz, it's just my self-love,
at like the end of any given day,
just really nice, and makes me be nice to myself.
I'll spare you guys.
Okay guys, so the next thing I'm gonna use
is St. Ives face spray, this one's lavender.
It's really relaxing right before bed,
makes me feel better.
(spritzing)
Like a setting spray.
I have dreams of being a YouTuber, can you guys tell.
So the last thing I'm gonna use,
I just put on Chapstick before bed,
because I don't wanna wake up with my lips
all dry and crusty, and this one's chamomile.
I like all peaceful smells before bed,
so I try to have everything smell nice and calm.
And then, okay, the very very last step,
that I have to do before bed,
I can't go to sleep without it.
I can't.
I really cannot go to sleep without putting on deodorant.
Makes me feel better,
feeling I'm gonna wake up, I'm gonna smell nice,
even though I'm gonna get in the shower,
I'm gonna work out before I shower,
and then I'll, you know what I'm saying.
I have to, I don't know,
maybe it's just a force of habit, not sure.
All of these steps are really just 'cause
they make me feel better, you know.
Like I said, my skin, I could really use whatever products
on my skin, and I don't know,
it just makes me feel happy things.
I like getting facials, that's usually my jam.
That is it, that's my nighttime skincare routine,
so thank you guys so much for watching.

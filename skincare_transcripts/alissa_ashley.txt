hey guys welcome back to i'm so used to
saying my channel
hey you guys my name is alyssa ashley
and tonight i'm going to show you guys
my nighttime routine this is where i
take off all my makeup
which i am dying to take off because it
was really hot today and i'm just ready
to see it go away
[Music]
i'm going to start with cleansing my
face for cleanser i like to use the
fenty skin
total cleanser this has been my favorite
lately because i just like how foamy and
sunny it is
and you just twist it open you squeeze
some
out she's a little thick went ahead and
got my little hands wet
and then you create the ladder
i won't give you guys asmr momentary
kind of mixed with skin crawl but
just hear it hear how creamy it is and
then you apply it to your face
cleansing my face and washing my makeup
is like the favorite step my routine
because i just
feel like i'm just removing all of that
makeup and that oil in the dirt
and i just like seeing my face so clean
afterwards and also
this cleanse is really creamy so it just
makes the experience a lot more fun
and it smells good i know my bangs went
away but they're so cute so i'm not
gonna clip them back i'm gonna keep them
there
and we'll get to the bang now let me
close my eyes
and let's work on removing eye shadow
now before anyone yells at me i will get
to my forehead foundation okay
i get it when i'm by the sink because
when i dip
over it moves the banks naturally you
know gravity
so do not worry about that okay now i'm
gonna try to go find the sink
should be right behind me and rinse this
off and come back
all right
i'm being a little bit wet but it's okay
maybe i should move them
okay so now in the next step of my
routine and this
i do not use every night my friend sean
garrett he's like the skin
doll skin guru he told me alyssa he said
you've lost your mind you could not use
that nightly i'm like okay sean how many
times can i use it he said three days
so i use it three nights a week
sometimes even two
um it really just depends but i really
like the kombucha 11
aha exfoliation power toner it's a
really long name by each of the people
and this is actually my second bottle
because i love it so
much and you just take a little cotton
square and you put some on it
i put a lot and i just go ahead and i
apply it to my face
i sometimes get like little pimples and
i'll like pick them
which i know you're not supposed to do
and i end up with little scars
and this just really helps with that
like a lot like i noticed that whenever
i use this product
slowly but surely those little mistakes
that i've made on my face they go away
i avoid like my eye area only because
that area is a little more sensitive and
i don't want to put something that is
technically a little bit more powerful
than what belongs in your eye area
underneath there
and i definitely get my forehead because
that's where i pick the most when i get
my pimples
so i like to keep my forehead as clear
as possible so this really helps with
that
and you guys see my big forehead which
is why i keep my bangs down and then on
some nights i like to use the polish
choice bha
and this one is two percent it's a
liquid exfoliant and this is another
product that my friend sean put me on to
but i don't use them together i don't
use it as often as the aha because i
like that product like so much
and i feel like for my skin that one is
a little more gentle but i will use this
whenever i need like an extra boost
especially with some of these dark marks
and i may use this like once a week but
nothing too
crazy because i was going overboard and
i had to tone it down
up next i'm gonna take all my serums my
friend sean i'm gonna keep referencing
him because honestly
he's made my routine so much better so i
like to give credit where credit is due
and he told me that for my skin because
i have dry skin i have to
really load up on hydration especially
if i'm using the ahas and the bhas i
want to make sure i'm hydrating
afterwards
so i'm gonna take the dr dennis gross
this is the hyaluronic marine hydration
booster and this
is a hyaluronic acid and i like to take
let me put it down so i can actually get
in my hand i like to take about
five six seven drops of that
and then apply it to my face
i used to get facials like before
quarantine
at the ula henriksen spa and i would
always get the hydrafacial
and i miss it so much but i've been
trying to do what i can
at home um because yeah i gotta maintain
i gotta
work with the times but i miss my hydra
facials and a hydrafacial basically just
gives you a lot of hydration which i
desperately need because my skin is so
dry
i used to suffer with eczema um and it's
definitely gotten better but i do feel
like as i creep into the fall winter
season my skin gets really dry
and i can feel it so i just like to load
up on as much hydration as possible
up next i have a serum from this indie
brand called red earth and this
is the hydrate supercharged serum with
tasmanian sea coat
take about three pumps of that and i
apply it to my face
i love red earth because they're all
natural and everything just smells so
good and refreshing i use one of their
lotions a lot
and it just makes my skin look so glowy
and just
fresh and that's what i like about their
products and this bang
the order in which i do my products
honestly speaking i just do what feels
best for me
but i probably do it a little bit wrong
but i'm just trying my best here
this is the fresh black tea kombucha
facial treatment essence
and this is another product that my
friend sean raves about
so i take a few drops of that and then i
press that into my skin
now for my night cream i have so many
different favorites you guys honestly
like
i face between so many different frogs i
love the belief aqua bomb the moisture
one
that one is my favorite i kid you not
i've run out of so many of those
and also another one of my favorites is
the tattoo dewy skin cream so tonight
i'm going to use that
i have so many moisturizers honestly
like whenever i go into sephora i buy a
moisturizer because i just love feeling
hydrated but the touch one
is super nice it makes you look so dewy
i'm sure you guys could just see that
instant do on my face
i love going to sleep with it
and then i know there's a lot of steps
but again my friend told me to load up
on hydration i love going to sleep with
a lot of hydration on my face
because i wake up and i look refreshed i
look hydrated and that's like my most
favorite thing in my morning so i'm
gonna take the you to the people super
berry hydrating glow dream mask this is
one of my favorite products
ever i use it a lot and you just take
about a scoop of that
you don't need a large amount pretty
sure that's a little bit of cat hair in
mine
that's just the life of a cat mom and
you apply it to your face
it's basically a mask that feels like a
moisturizer because you know some masks
they feel very masky i like that this
one doesn't because you're able to sleep
in it and leave it on overnight
and i love those kind of masks because i
just feel like okay cool i get to go to
bed
with this mask i have to wake up and be
all hydrated
i like masks that you wash off too but
the ones that you can keep on just feel
special
next up for eye cream this is also from
you to the people and i honestly love
their products because
i do have sensitive skin so sometimes i
do break out from products but none of
theirs have ever broken me out
and they're just all very gentle for
their skin so i do think that
my skin likes them a lot so i just stick
to what my skin knows and this is the
superfood peptide eye cream
i'm already opening up and everything
before i show you guys
and i'm just gonna take a little bit of
that and use my ring finger
to apply i like to dab it on
and then smooth it on like so
and now for my last steps my skin is
done but i do have little extra
steps in my routine especially as of
late because i'm trying to nourish my
lashes
this is by peter thomas roth and this is
the lashes to die for
and this is the turbo conditioning lash
enhancer and i just apply that
it's kind of hard to look up while i do
it but this just
nourishes your lashes and hopefully in a
couple weeks i have really nice thick
long lashes genetically speaking
the chances are like 50 50. but hey
i'd rather hydrate them and nourish them
and
try then not try and the last step in my
routine is
my lip mask and this from laneige i like
the berry one
and i just yeah to put it simple i make
sure that my lips are hydrated because
they're pretty big they're pretty out
there and if they're dry you're gonna
notice it
so the guys stay luscious you know
so there you guys have it that is my
nighttime skincare routine
i really especially enjoy skincare
because i just feel like that's that
moment
of my day at the end of it where i'm
just spending time with myself and
giving myself that self-care
love and that extra attention so if you
do not do that already at least spend
10 minutes of your time 15 if you have
it
to just sit with yourself ignore
everybody put your phone down
and just do your skincare because i can
guarantee you're going to feel amazing
afterwards because i feel amazing when i
feel like i'm taking care of myself
other than that i was about to say my
outro to my channel but we are not on my
channel
so i guess this is where we part ways
again my name is alyssa ashley
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
i'll see you guys around
peace out

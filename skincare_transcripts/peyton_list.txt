hi i'm peyton list and this is my
nighttime skincare routine
[Music]
so i'm currently in a bathroom that is
my dressing room on set
and i just finished working so i thought
i would
use it to my full advantage because it's
very fancy in here
first off this is the toothbrush i've
been using it's a compostable bamboo
toothbrush by
bite and it came with these champagne
toothpaste bites
which are pretty yummy also you don't
use plastic it's glass
never had toothpaste like this but
tastes really good
i'm going to start off with my derma e
skin distress
cbd cleanser it's super calming and
there's aloe vera in it
i feel like my skin is really sensitive
and this has worked
wonders i feel like everything irritates
it for a while there i was just using an
insane amount of products i think i was
overdoing it to the extreme um so i just
simplified my routine a lot this is what
works for me
it says there's 250 milligrams of
cbd in it it's so pretty too it has like
this
sheer pearl effect on it
i feel like on set is where i really
found my best
skincare products i've learned things
from so many women
and even just sitting in a room tonight
i was sitting in a room with wardrobe
and
hair and makeup and i feel like i just
pick their brains
about what they like all night and i
just learned so much
okay i'm gonna go in one more time
dry also
i think these towels are so pretty i
just got them from love shack fancy
if i still have eye makeup underneath
i'll go in with a little cotton pad with
clinique
take the day off i'm not gonna lie i
don't have a cotton pad i'm gonna use a
little bit of toilet paper
people please don't hate on me okay
we'll be right back
i feel like i always watch tig talks on
youtubes or people are just
hating on skincare routines and just
destroying people for what they do and i
feel like i've learned
so much from that i learned from tick
tock no more witch hazel i used to use
witch hazel all the time and apparently
it's
super drying all the witch hazel toners
and everything else so i stopped doing
that in the last few months and i'm not
gonna lie i think it really was drying
out my skin
this is another derma e hydrating mist
has hyaluronic acid rose water
coconut water
i just love a good mist it just feels so
nice
i usually keep it in my purse during the
summer and
if it's a hot day and i'm wearing no
makeup just pull that out
and give one to everyone around me my
lips get crazy dry especially on set i
feel like i'm always
changing lip colors and everything else
i love this
brown sugar lip scrub by fresh the sugar
lip polish
so i'll just take a little bit
and someone just showed me a trick
yesterday if you take a
toothbrush you can scrub your lips
um of all the dry skin so that's way to
do it
and then i'll just rinse it off i also
love the dior
uh lip scrub it's in a lipstick
so you don't even need a rinse or
anything that's my go-to for the daytime
i like keeping that in my purse and then
usually i'll have a big tub of aquaphor
but really i'm not picky with my lip
balms just whatever i can slather on i
like putting on a really thick layer
before i go to bed
uh this is the mario badesco mint lip
balm i also like their rose one
okay next these moss morning sleep deal
pads they're hydrating and they're also
exfoliating they have hyaluronic acid
they are so nice i used to get um
facials from rosette who created these
and she's just a great human and also
she made a really great product and they
are
biodegradable and super gentle on the
skin
um they also smell amazing
i feel like i just have started to add
neck care into my routine i'm really
trying to
do the whole anti-aging preventative
thing
so for my breakouts this acuclear
purifying lotion by dmk
i think this is my favorite product i
use on my skin just because
it really does clear up breakouts i had
terrible acne on my chin and everything
else i always tried to hide it
um i never really took off my makeup i
don't think i would have been brave
enough to do this video
um a year ago but since doing the
routine that i do now
i have felt so much more confident
it's actually makes me emotional
and i just will use i think i did a
little too much but usually like a
little
pml and i'll go in on my chin
and lather it on and this derma e again
the skin distressing calming
cbd this is the moisturizer and
i love this my skin loves it my skin is
so happy
okay so i just take a little bit
and
thing i have to say that has saved my
skin is just
to stop picking i used to pick any sweet
my favorite thing i love watching dr
pimple popper videos and all of it but
the more i picked i'm just not a
professional and the more the bacteria
would just spread underneath
i feel like if i have a breakout now i
just try to
treat it and and let it sit and if i
need to go get it taken care of i'll go
get extractions
and i'm not going to use this tonight a
makeup artist that i just work with
it's called zippity doo dab it's a spot
treatment for
big pimples so if i had one i would put
it on but i really love this stuff
and that is my nighttime skincare
routine thank you guys
for getting ready for bed with me
